# TypeScript Best Practices for Modern Development

TypeScript has become an essential tool for modern JavaScript development. Here are some best practices that will help you write better, more maintainable code.

## 1. Use Strict Type Checking

Always enable strict mode in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true
  }
}
```

## 2. Leverage Union Types

Union types are powerful for handling multiple possible types:

```typescript
type Status = 'loading' | 'success' | 'error'
type ID = string | number

function handleStatus(status: Status) {
  switch (status) {
    case 'loading':
      return 'Loading...'
    case 'success':
      return 'Success!'
    case 'error':
      return 'Error occurred'
  }
}
```

## 3. Use Generics for Reusability

Generics make your code more flexible and reusable:

```typescript
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T
  status: number
  message: string
}

function fetchData<T>(url: string): Promise<ApiResponse<T>> {
  return fetch(url).then(res => res.json())
}
```

## 4. Prefer Type Assertions Over Any

When you need to work with dynamic content, use type assertions:

```typescript
// Bad
const user = data as any

// Good
interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
}
const user = data as User
```

## Conclusion

Following these TypeScript best practices will help you write more robust and maintainable code. Remember to always prioritize type safety and readability.
