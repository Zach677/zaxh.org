# React Router v7 Practical Guide

React Router v7 brings many exciting new features, let's explore these improvements together.

## Main New Features

### 1. Simplified Route Configuration
The new version provides a more concise way to configure routes:

```typescript
import { type RouteConfig, index, route } from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  index("routes/home.tsx"),
  route("about", "routes/about.tsx"),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

### 2. Improved Type Support
v7 provides better TypeScript support, including auto-generated type definitions.

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Better code splitting
- Optimized preloading mechanism
- Reduced bundle size

## Best Practices

1. **Use File System Routing**: Leverage convention over configuration principles
2. **Proper Use of Loaders**: Preload data at the route level
3. **Error Boundaries**: Add appropriate error handling for each route

React Router v7 is a powerful upgrade, worth learning and using for every React developer.
