# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a UI issue where post titles exhibit a shaking or jittery behavior when users hover over them. The current implementation uses a translate transform that can cause visual instability, negatively impacting the user experience when browsing the blog posts list.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want post titles to have smooth and stable hover effects, so that I can navigate the posts list without visual distractions or jarring movements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over a post title THEN the title SHALL display a smooth visual feedback without any shaking or jittery movement
2. WHEN a user moves their cursor away from a post title THEN the title SHALL return to its original state smoothly
3. WHEN multiple rapid hover events occur on a post title THEN the title SHALL maintain visual stability throughout the interaction

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want consistent hover behavior across all post titles, so that the browsing experience feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over any post title in the list THEN all titles SHALL exhibit the same hover behavior
2. WHEN viewing the posts list on different screen sizes THEN the hover effects SHALL work consistently across all viewport sizes
3. WHEN using the site in both light and dark themes THEN the hover effects SHALL maintain the same visual quality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want the hover effects to enhance readability and accessibility, so that I can easily identify which post I'm about to click.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over a post title THEN the visual change SHALL clearly indicate the interactive state
2. WHEN a user hovers over a post title THEN the text SHALL remain fully readable and properly aligned
3. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the focus states SHALL provide equivalent visual feedback to hover states
