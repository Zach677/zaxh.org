# Design Document

## Overview

The current post title hover effect uses `hover:translate-x-1` which causes a horizontal translation that can result in visual shaking or jittery behavior. This design addresses the issue by replacing the problematic transform with more stable CSS properties that provide smooth visual feedback without layout shifts.

## Architecture

The solution focuses on the posts listing page (`app/routes/posts.tsx`) where post titles are rendered within article elements. The fix involves modifying the hover styles to use properties that don't cause layout shifts or visual instability.

## Components and Interfaces

### Affected Components
- **Posts Route Component** (`app/routes/posts.tsx`): Contains the post listing with hover effects
- **CSS Styles** (`app/app.css`): May need additional utility classes for smooth hover effects

### Current Implementation Analysis
```tsx
<Link
  to={`/posts/${post.slug}`}
  className="block transition-all duration-200 hover:translate-x-1"
>
  <h2 className="text-h4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-2 group-hover:text-blue-600 dark:group-hover:text-blue-400 transition-colors">
    {post.title}
  </h2>
</Link>
```

**Issues Identified:**
1. `hover:translate-x-1` causes horizontal movement that can trigger layout recalculations
2. The transform may interact poorly with text rendering, causing visual instability
3. The movement can feel jarring rather than providing smooth feedback

## Data Models

No data model changes are required for this fix. The solution is purely presentational.

## Error Handling

### Potential Issues and Mitigations

1. **CSS Transition Conflicts**: Ensure new hover styles don't conflict with existing transitions
   - Solution: Use specific transition properties rather than `transition-all`

2. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Some CSS properties may behave differently across browsers
   - Solution: Test hover effects in major browsers and provide fallbacks if needed

3. **Performance Impact**: Complex hover effects could impact performance on lower-end devices
   - Solution: Use GPU-accelerated properties and avoid expensive CSS operations

## Design Solutions

### Option 1: Color and Opacity Based Hover (Recommended)
Replace the translate effect with subtle color changes and opacity adjustments:
- Remove `hover:translate-x-1`
- Enhance the existing color transition
- Add subtle background color change or shadow effect
- Use `transform: scale()` for minimal, stable scaling if movement is desired

### Option 2: Background and Border Effects
Use background color changes and border effects:
- Add subtle background color on hover
- Use border-left accent for visual feedback
- Maintain text color transitions

### Option 3: Shadow and Elevation Effects
Create depth perception without movement:
- Add subtle box-shadow on hover
- Use elevation changes to indicate interactivity
- Combine with color transitions

## Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Approach (Option 1)
1. Remove the problematic `hover:translate-x-1` class
2. Enhance the color transition system
3. Add a subtle scale transform (`hover:scale-[1.02]`) if movement is desired
4. Ensure smooth transitions with appropriate duration and easing
5. Test across different devices and browsers

### CSS Classes to Implement
```css
/* Enhanced hover state without translation */
.post-link-hover {
  transition: color 0.2s ease, transform 0.2s ease, background-color 0.2s ease;
}

.post-link-hover:hover {
  transform: scale(1.01); /* Minimal, stable scaling */
  background-color: rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.05); /* Subtle background */
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
1. **Hover Behavior Testing**
   - Test hover on/off transitions for smoothness
   - Verify no visual shaking or jittery movement
   - Test rapid hover events (mouse moving quickly over titles)

2. **Cross-browser Testing**
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Verify consistent behavior across browsers

3. **Responsive Testing**
   - Test hover effects on different screen sizes
   - Ensure mobile touch interactions work properly

4. **Theme Testing**
   - Test hover effects in both light and dark themes
   - Verify color contrast and visibility

### Accessibility Testing
1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Ensure focus states provide equivalent visual feedback
   - Test tab navigation through post links

2. **Screen Reader Compatibility**
   - Verify hover effects don't interfere with screen reader functionality

### Performance Testing
1. **Animation Performance**
   - Monitor for smooth 60fps transitions
   - Test on lower-end devices if possible

## Success Criteria

The fix will be considered successful when:
1. Post titles no longer exhibit shaking or jittery behavior on hover
2. Hover effects provide clear visual feedback for interactivity
3. Transitions are smooth and consistent across all browsers
4. No performance degradation is observed
5. Accessibility standards are maintained or improved
